# Technical Studies Guest Lesson Plan
A workshop/guest lesson plan for high schoolers to get a better idea of the kind of work students at technical studies do. Part of ASML technology scholarship ambassador project.


## Technical_Studies_Guest_Lesson.ppt
This powerpoint can be used during the guest lesson to guide students. Notes on slides include additional information for the teachers.

## Exercises
This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks for the exercises used in the guest lesson. Students can access these files with Google Collab. This is useful as it does not require students to have preinstalled Python or any of its IDEs. Only prerequisite is that they have to have a Google account they can use to log in.
