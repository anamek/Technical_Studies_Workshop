# Technical Studies Guest Lesson Plan
This is a workshop/guest lesson plan for high schoolers to get a better idea of the kind of work students do when studying technical studies (such as e.g. Applied Mathematics, Applied Physics, Aerospace Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Data Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering).

We provide these files for teachers to use during their mathematics/physics/programming classes.

The idea is to introduce students to a problem involving a moving car, starting from simple physics exercises, and moving to more complicated ones. Students are expected to solve some problems on paper and the code in Python is provided to them. As the problems become increasingly more difficult students should realise that it is no longer to solve the problems without programming. The programming exercises, especially towards the end (exercise 5) are meant to be fun for students to play around with and see the results of changing a simulation in real time.

There is no programming knowledge expected from students to complete these exercises. The key takeaway is the way of approaching a problem as well as some very basic understanding of how the tool of programming is used on a day-to-day basis in all technical studies (not only computer science as students could expect).

## Technical_Studies_Guest_Lesson.ppt
This PowerPoint can be used during the guest lesson to guide students. Notes on slides include additional information for the teachers.

## Exercises
This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks for the exercises used in the guest lesson. You can download the files when you select them. We suggest uploading the files to Google Drive and opening it using the free add-on "Google Collab". The link to this can be shared easily and students can access them from their laptops simply through a browser. This is useful as it does not require students to have preinstalled Python or any of its IDEs. The only prerequisite is that they have to have a Google account they can use to log in. It is important to make copies of the files for all students so they can all make individual changes that will not affect other students' files.

## Flyer.pdf

This flyer contains an overview of technical studies given at TU Eindhoven, TU Delft and University of Twente. The flyer can be shared electronically or printed and handed out to students. It also includes a comparison of the three cities, as well as links to useful websites for students deciding what to study.
